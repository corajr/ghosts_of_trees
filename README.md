This is the Processing source for "The Ghosts of Trees" (example video: <https://vimeo.com/38447960>). It uses so-called [stochastic L-systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system#Stochastic_grammars) to generate the "trees" -- these are rewriting systems in which the production rules occur with differing probabilities, resulting in a randomly-generated drawing.

As time passes, sonic events are triggered corresponding to the path taken by the tree as it "grows." These events may be sent directly to SuperCollider, or written to a file as a "score" which SuperCollider can then process.

(Note that sound files have not been included. Unfortunately, I lost the cello recording used to produce the video above, although the files from Freesound are still available.)
